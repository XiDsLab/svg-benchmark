# Scalability

- downsampling.R Generate down-sampling datasets based on three reference dataset3.

- time&memory_plot.R Organize and plot the results of time loss and memory usage.

The codes for recording memory and time are in the 'method' file (we have included these codes in each SVG running algorithm).

## Dependency
The scripts in this repository are excuted in R (v4.3.1) and use the following R packages:
ggplot2==3.3.4, reticulate==1.34.0
